      <h2 id="main-title">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Throne and Fang (the “Game”) is developed and published by <strong>Creative Brio</strong>.
        We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains
        what information we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, and the choices you have.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="scope">
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>
        This policy applies to the Game distributed through app stores and to any services directly operated by Creative Brio,
        including online turn-based multiplayer, in-game advertising, and analytics. If you use third-party sign-in (for example,
        Play Games Services) that third party's privacy policy also applies to information provided to them.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="data-we-collect">
      <h2>Information we collect</h2>
      <p>We collect the minimum information necessary to operate and improve the Game:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gameplay data:</strong> non-identifying game state, moves, match results, and timestamps to enable play and match synchronization.</li>
        <li><strong>Device & technical data:</strong> platform, OS version, device model, app version, crash reports (automatically collected).</li>
        <li><strong>In-app purchases & virtual currency:</strong> transaction receipts or actions related to gems or purchases (to manage balances and restore purchases).</li>
        <li><strong>Sign-in info (optional):</strong> If you sign in via Google Play Games (GPGS) we may receive the Play Games player ID and display name to enable online multiplayer and friend invites. We do not obtain your Google account password.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising identifiers:</strong> advertising IDs used by ad networks to serve personalized ads where permitted.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> anonymous or pseudonymous analytics events (for example, "game_completed", "difficulty_selected", "ad_watched_undo") to improve gameplay and measure engagement.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="how-we-use">
      <h2>How we use the information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To operate multiplayer matches, save and sync game state, and allow turn-based play.</li>
        <li>To process and validate in-app purchases and virtual currency flows (such as entry fees and payouts).</li>
        <li>To provide, personalize, and measure advertising (including rewarded ads used for in-game actions like undo).</li>
        <li>To monitor and fix crashes, improve performance, and analyze how the Game is used.</li>
        <li>To detect and prevent fraud, cheating, or other abuse of the Game/online services.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="ads-analytics-gpgs">
      <h2>Third-party services & ads</h2>
      <p>
        We use third-party services to provide features in the Game:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Mobile Ads (AdMob):</strong> used to serve interstitial and rewarded ads. Ads may use advertising identifiers. Ad behavior and opt-outs are managed by the ad provider.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Analytics (optional):</strong> used to collect anonymized usage events (e.g. game_completed). Events are used to improve the Game and are not used to build a marketing profile of an identified user by us.</li>
        <li><strong>Play Games Services (GPGS):</strong> used for sign-in and turn-based multiplayer matchmaking. When you use GPGS, information shared depends on your Play Games settings and Google's privacy policy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These providers have their own privacy policies. You can opt out of interest-based ads via your device settings or by following the ad provider's opt-out instructions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="data-sharing">
      <h2>Data sharing & recipients</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell personal data. We may share data with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Service providers who perform functions on our behalf (cloud hosting, analytics, advertising).</li>
        <li>When required by law or to respond to lawful requests by public authorities.</li>
        <li>With your consent (for example, if you choose to share match screenshots or invite friends).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="data-retention">
      <h2>Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain gameplay and technical logs for as long as needed to provide the Game and to comply with legal obligations.
        If you request deletion of your account data (see "Your rights" below), we will remove or anonymize personal data unless
        retention is required for legal reasons.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="security">
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data. No service is completely secure; if you believe
        your data has been compromised, contact us immediately (see below).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="children">
      <h2>Children's privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The Game is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13.
        If you are a parent or guardian and become aware that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us
        so we can delete that information.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section id="cookies">
      <h2>Cookies & local storage</h2>
      <p>
        The Game may use local storage and device-level identifiers (for example to store save games or cached data).
        Web cookies are not used by the in-app game itself, but any web pages or webviews we show (privacy/policy pages, support)
        may set standard cookies according to those websites' policies.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="changes">
      <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this privacy policy occasionally. If changes are material, we will post the updated effective date here.
        Continued use of the Game after changes indicates acceptance of the revised policy.
